        <p className="k1" style={{marginLeft:"100px",marginRight:"100px",marginTop:"",fontFamily:"cursive",fontSize:"20px"}}> So you've just moved to a new city or looking to do so soon. This is likely to be for studying there or you've just gotten your first job and are looking to move to that city. Not only is the city new to you, so are the people and places except a few references whose name and contact number you carry in your phone.

Of all the worries you carry on your shoulder in this move, the biggest by far is where will you stay. The friend or acquaintance is good to crash on for the D day of your arrival but no longer. The other options available to you are a hotel room in the long lease, a rented house, one of the new Book a house for a month a time systems or being a paying guest at a house.

You already know that a hotel is too costly and not prudent even if you had the money to afford it. You can also see some glaring issues with the newer systems in that staying there long term comes not with a binding contract but a website booking similar to if you were booking a night. All that leaves you with is renting a house or being a PG. Let's look at these two in more detail.

Renting a house sounds the most prudent option if you're there for long until you realize that the house is not the only thing on the charts then. Meeting the owners just once or twice has its own set of issues from trust in you for them and vice versa. Then there is the struggle of getting homeowners who are willing to give you, a student or new joinee in the work force, a house. Once you surpass these, there is the worry of finding the right staff to work for your house, coordinating time with them, coordinating with the guards and neighbours and talking all the time by trial and error to find out which rules apply to your house, locality and the neighborhood in general. Seems tiresome for just you?
